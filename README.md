# Hungram
Hungram revolutionizes food donation and distribution, connecting surplus food resources with those in need.
Through our platform, donors can easily contribute excess food items, cooked meals, and consumable products.
Utilizing cutting-edge technology, Hungram streamlines the process, ensuring efficient and timely distribution to communities facing hunger challenges.
This platform will link restaurants, households, and communities that are ready to donate food items, cooked foods, and other consumable products to the less privileged.
This project will reduce the level of food wastage, reduce the dependency of the poor on resources that are been shared by the government which is mostly enjoyed by people of upper castes.
Together, we can create a world where no one goes hungry. Join Hungram and be a part of the solution to end hunger for good.
